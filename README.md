# HCI_project
Project for university class Human-computer interaction.

The project is based on comparison of mouse controlling modalities through FittsStudy (control using head and control using gestures).

The R scripts in this repository contain complete statisical analysis of results, both quantitive (FittsStudy output) and qualitative (questionnaire answers).
